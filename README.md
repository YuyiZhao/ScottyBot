The tutorial I followed can be found here: https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/https-medium-com-javascript-in-plain-english-how-to-build-a-simple-chrome-extension-in-vanilla-javascript-e52b2994aeeb

The Extension takes in a username and displays a welcome message to the user.

How does it work,
- The Extension works when a user enables the extension and opens a new tab. 
- A settings button is displayed and when clicked a text input area appears below the button.
- When a username is inputted it gets stored to Chromes Local Storage.
- Pulling from the Local Storage, a welcome meesage gets displayed with whatever username was inputted
